## Install virtualenv and Django
First you have to install the virtual environment.
```
1. $ [sudo] pip install virtualenv
```
And then you need to make the directory where ```venv``` is the name of the directory.
```
2. $ python3 -m venv myvenv
```
When that's done, activate the venv, upgrade pip and install Django (we used Django 1.10.0).
```
3. $ source bin/activate
4. (myvenv) ~$ pip install --upgrade
5. (myvenv) ~$ pip install django~=1.10.0
```
